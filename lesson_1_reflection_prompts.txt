How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could easily compare the versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I wouldnt waste time searching for the old version I need

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Auto saving might save at the wrong time - wouldnt br logically related

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is made for coding and many programs use multiple related files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all commit ids and git diff lets you compare them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know I could go back I find the last commit before things went wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control for my web projects
