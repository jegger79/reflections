When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to be able to work on your project using multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes are made by others - you may not like them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of Github repositories made on Github.com. Clones are copies made to local computer from Github.com Branches are variations in your project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you are working offline, you have the latest commits.
